          Brett Adamson is a Senior Software Engineer specializing in front end
          web development. Brett grew up in Pasco Washington on a farm and began
          programming while studying at Brigham Young University. As a student,
          Brett completed a 4 month summer internship at the Pacific Northwest
          National Laboratory before graduating in 2018.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Brett spent the first few years of his career in larger organizations
          and teams as a front e n ddeveloper. Since April of 2021, Brett has
          worked on small innovative startup teams, prioritizingvelocity of
          development and autonomy of work.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Most recently, as a Senior Software Engineer at a fin-tech startup
          called Swyf, Brett played a pivotal role building a robust
          peer-to-peer payment system. His responsibilities were designing,
          architecting, and developing the entire user experience, including iOS
          and Android mobile applications and a full-stack web application. Now
          Brett is looking to join a larger team where he can continue to be a
          key contributor, while learning from others.

        <p className="paragraph">
          Joining a stage Ostartup, with less than 5 months of runway, appears
          unwise to most. Additionally, the challenge of adopting a new
          technology and building a consumer facing application from scratch
          before runway depletes is daunting.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Swyf launched its MVP to beta after only 6 weeks of development. It
          launched more broadly shortly after in early 2023. Swyf's team
          optimized for velocity in order to get to market quickly, attack
          users, and raise funds. The consumer facing side of Swyf consisted of
          iOS and Android mobile applications and a full-stack w e b
          application. Those applications were built utilizing modern
          technologies consisting of but not limited to Typescript, React,
          Next.js, GraphQL, Apollo, React Native, Expo, and EAS.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          This presentation aims to recount how Swyf user facing applications
          were designed, architected, built, and launched with only a small team
          of 3 engineers. It will analyze the team's processes, approach to
          problem solving, and t i m eoptimization techniques used to increase
          velocity at all costs. Most importantly, ti will dive into Swyf as a
          product and how it was built, shipped, and improved upon.
